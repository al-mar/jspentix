A JavaScript version of Pentix video game.

The original version of this game was released for DOS by Marta & Adrian Soncodi in 1986.

In this implementation I tried to reproduce some key aspects of the original game. It wasn't my intention to make a full clone of the program. I just tried some programming techniques in an entertaining way. But I love the result and play it from time to time.

You can use the following keys:

    7 of left arrow     - to move piece to the left
    8 or up arrow       - to rotate piece
    9 or right arrow    - to move piece to the right
    space or down arrow - to drop piece
    1                   - to switch next on/off
    esc                 - to start a new game
